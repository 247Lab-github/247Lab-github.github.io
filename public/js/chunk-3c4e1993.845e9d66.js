Zhou Li’s recent works distill the feelings and emotions precipitated from individual perceptions into the broader social and historical processes and translating what she’s drawn from the fast-changing events of the present into tangible and resounding forms through her artistic expressions.","This solo project, Tracing Peach Blossom Spring at the Pingshan Art Museum, adopts Tao Yuanming\'s The Peach Blossom Spring from the Eastern Jin Dynasty as a fulcrum to trace emotional experiences in the course of history with a visionary concept. Tracing, in the exhibition title, a verb used in its active tense, differentiates Zhou Li\'s artworks from representations of Tao Yuanming\'s narrative. Meanwhile, the term alludes to how reality and the ideal realm connect through the footsteps of the Wuling fisherman despite the story\'s inconsequential outcome. The artist uses this untraceable outcome as an analogy for the unique and non-replicable nature of our emotional journey, which resonates with the notion of “traces of emotions, often emphasized in her works.","Zhou Li designates the color pink as the base tone for this series of works that bring together personal experience and ideal realm. Nurtured by traditional Chinese art from a young age and her lasting habit of practicing calligraphy, the artist applies the monochromatic variations known as the five shades of ink to feature multiple applications of a singular tonality in her works on canvas. Were we to revisit Western art history, we would notice that the color pink, intended to soothe pain and bring hope in many classic artworks, coincides with Zhou Li\'s reason for adopting the same color for the Peach Blossom Spring series, which was initially conceived to convey her grief of losing a family member and the experience of bringing a new life to the world. ","In the past, Zhou Li conceived her self-portrait to look at the world with one eye open and the other shut, which embodied a simultaneous perspective of introspection and outward view. This time, the site-specific installation consists of mirror images of two worlds connected with a visible path, eliminating any one-directional sense of time and space. Furthermore, it creates a gate between The Peach Blossom Spring and reality through its seemingly radiant light, which opens up two dimensions with a minimal approach. On the occasion of this exhibition, Zhou Li invites the viewer to join her on a journey to envision The Peach Blossom Spring through the various perceptual experiences of her works of art.

Instead, it presents another clue offered by Architect Yung Ho Chang. Through the space design and installations, the playground of “perspective” and “seeing” is thereby established.","As the most important architect in China, Yung Ho Chang has not only designed many eye-catching architectural works, but also participated in a large number of art exhibitions and theoretical studies with a complex system of his own, covering from the changes in Asian urbanization to the experimentation of exhibition construction. The driving force for the development of this system lies in the architect\'s broad vision and diversified exploration. He constantly returns to the starting point of architecture, reflecting on and reconstructing all basic elements, thus opening up the possibility to re-understand architecture.","The five installations in the exhibition of “Looking for” are presenting a brief history of perspective. The work begins with the experiment regarding linear perspective carried out in the 14th century by Italian Architect Filippo Brunelleschi who pioneered the era of constructing spaces with scientific methods. It is the beginning of the entire exhibition and also a metaphor for Yung Ho Chang’s working routines. Here, he has paved a way for us to look for “perspective”.","Down the journey led by Yung Ho Chang, we can look for the one-point perspective created by the Architect Andrea Palladio in the 16th century and the complicated experience of abstract urban spaces in current days; we can take a guess about the camera obscura used by Vermeer when he painted in the 17th century; we can learn from the Painter Kazimir Malevich in the early 20th century to create 6 rotatable viewfinders; we can also find the perspective relationship between windows, rooms, and furniture in the movie “Rear Window” produced by Alfred Hitchcock, and create a brand new “Window” thereof.","Pieces in “Looking for” have formed a space game pointing to the history of the architecture itself with the imagination of the possibility for perspective. In the game, the time and space created by architects and artists from different eras have never been interrupted. They\'re mixed together, with no distinction between ancient and modern, the past and the present.","In other words, “Looking for” has intercepted a static experience through precise construction, designing multiple channels for “seeing”, which makes originally abstract motion clear and concrete. We complete the process of discovery by “seeing”, which, in turn, is merged with here.","But these five works are different from traditional architecture as they are creating a  pure spatial game and experiment. “Looking for” brings us back to the root of architecture by removing the practicality and theme, returning to the core elements that form the theme. That being said, these “installations” are not models, nor are they tools and paths for the construction. They exist independently, with their own order, destination and meaning.","However, these installations are not entirely “art” either, for they are rationally designed rather than merely imagined. They\'re derived from the pursuit for knowledge starting from perspective studies in the Enlightenment. Everything about perspective needs to be recorded, so the means of description must be accurate. They are not “painted” or “carved”, but calculated. It is the accurate means and tightly knitted creation and verification that endow these works with purposes, functions and meanings completely different from artistic creations (perspective in installations, sculptures, paintings).","Yung Ho Chang travels through movies, paintings, and architectures of various eras, looking for a space experience that can stand out from traditional perspectives, and seeking ways to design time through space. How should time be spent and where should it travel through? “Looking for” has become the intermediate zone between architecture and art, inspiring people to think about space, self, and existence in a different way during the exploration of the space consciousness in the human world."],"planner_des":{"curator":"curator","curator_name":"Cui Cancan ","exhibition_series":"Exhibition Series","exhibition_series_title":"Perspectival Playground","QR_code":"QRcode.png"},"related_exhibitions":[{"index":1,"content_title":"Beyond Social Text: Duo Solo Exhibition of Li Mingchang and Zhang Jinhui","time":"2021.3.28-6.20","warning_content":{"level":"PAM-warning-color-1","content":"On Now"},"background_image":{"show":false,"url":"exhibitions_img_1.png"},"element":null,"rows":1},{"index":2,"content_title":"Beyond Social Text: Duo Solo Exhibition of Li Mingchang and Zhang Jinhui","time":"2021.3.28-6.20","warning_content":{"level":"PAM-warning-color-2","content":"Ends Soon"},"element":null,"current_row":1},{"index":3,"content_title":"Beyond Social Text: Duo Solo Exhibition of Li Mingchang and Zhang Jinhui","time":"2021.3.28-6.20","element":null,"current_row":1}]}')},8026:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"title":"Beyond Social Text","subtitle":"","author":"Mingchang and Zhang Jinhui","cover_imageurl":"exhibitionsContent2021-1_img1.jpg","time":"2021.03.28 - 2021.06.20","content":["Both Li Mingchang and Zhang Jinhui use oil paintings to illustrate the relationship between daily life and symbolism. These works may be perceived as social texts, which are combinations of signals, signs, and symbols. Simply looking at the objects and scenes described in these pictures, they’re all about the ancient styles of human, nature, and work, with everything being part of a song.","Some work is sacred, and thus will naturally be understood as the manifestation of sacred power. Beyond the natural forms, the continuous changes of human life are often incorporated into the progressive logic of rationality. In such a process, people\'s values must be closely related to production and lifestyle. This connection is often overlooked whenever we encounter a stage of social transformation or rapid development. Artists use their own descriptions to reconfirm the relationship between concept and life, which is both a mission and a destiny.","Even in the current industrial society, agricultural ethics clearly exists. This kind of coexistence is manifested at least in our yearning for an ideal life. The description of traditional aesthetics will still be maintained despite our modernity: people live in harmony in the countryside and mountains. This yearning, when externalized as a representation, is an image of pastoral life and work scenes. In recent painting creations, this type of motif is easily confined to a large number of depictions that already existed in the art history, but these depictions are often presented with simple and straightforward languages that share similarities with documentary photography. The value and poetry of the work itself are, on the contrary, difficult for the artists to obtain through depiction.","Fortunately, we can meet some specific individuals who unanimously adhere to a series of values about the human spirit, highly relevant to our life. They\'ll never perceive the relationship between people and nature as either backward or advanced. From the picture itself, there is no expression related to realistic language in the general sense. It neither portrays realistic scenes like photographs nor develops grand narratives with no crude cut-in and superficial mixing of traditions.
