Zhou Li’s recent works distill the feelings and emotions precipitated from individual perceptions into the broader social and historical processes and translating what she’s drawn from the fast-changing events of the present into tangible and resounding forms through her artistic expressions.","This solo project, Tracing Peach Blossom Spring at the Pingshan Art Museum, adopts Tao Yuanming's The Peach Blossom Spring from the Eastern Jin Dynasty as a fulcrum to trace emotional experiences in the course of history with a visionary concept. Tracing, in the exhibition title, a verb used in its active tense, differentiates Zhou Li's artworks from representations of Tao Yuanming's narrative. Meanwhile, the term alludes to how reality and the ideal realm connect through the footsteps of the Wuling fisherman despite the story's inconsequential outcome. The artist uses this untraceable outcome as an analogy for the unique and non-replicable nature of our emotional journey, which resonates with the notion of “traces of emotions, often emphasized in her works.","Zhou Li designates the color pink as the base tone for this series of works that bring together personal experience and ideal realm. Nurtured by traditional Chinese art from a young age and her lasting habit of practicing calligraphy, the artist applies the monochromatic variations known as the five shades of ink to feature multiple applications of a singular tonality in her works on canvas. Were we to revisit Western art history, we would notice that the color pink, intended to soothe pain and bring hope in many classic artworks, coincides with Zhou Li's reason for adopting the same color for the Peach Blossom Spring series, which was initially conceived to convey her grief of losing a family member and the experience of bringing a new life to the world. ","In the past, Zhou Li conceived her self-portrait to look at the world with one eye open and the other shut, which embodied a simultaneous perspective of introspection and outward view. This time, the site-specific installation consists of mirror images of two worlds connected with a visible path, eliminating any one-directional sense of time and space. Furthermore, it creates a gate between The Peach Blossom Spring and reality through its seemingly radiant light, which opens up two dimensions with a minimal approach. On the occasion of this exhibition, Zhou Li invites the viewer to join her on a journey to envision The Peach Blossom Spring through the various perceptual experiences of her works of art. Let us step into this expanded site of affects by bringing this literary text into the context of what we are experiencing.

Both living a drifting life, two artists and intellectuals had very special representations and interpretations of modernity and its induced changes. Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain and Walter Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction could both be taken as important turning points for conceptual and technical art to universal aesthetic experience in society. Following Fountain and Dadaism are thoughts and practices of conceptual art, concept of ready-made, installation art, minimalism and Arte Povera. In the days after The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, photography as a form of art set the foundation for the rising new media art and made those engaged in art work reflect on authenticity and narration in graphics and the existence of aesthetic forms.\n    Being non-graphic and tilting towards materials, Duchamp’s art explored the beauty of ready-made and cumulative patchworks. Art is no longer an aesthetic concept of graphic narration, color and composition. This freed art from intrinsic clues and made it merely a material existence, or a means to reflect upon the present, providing visual experience to support the pondering over what is contemporary. It could also been regarded as a close connection as in Live in Your Head – When Attitudes Become Form, a show curated by Harald Szeeman in 1969.\n    The technology issue in visual experience as supported by Benjamin, and the tension from artistic originality and replicability when technology intervenes pioneered Marshall Mcluhan’s Media is the Message. To understand art, technology, aesthetics and social changes after 1900, it is necessary to return to tensions between specific artists and materials, concepts and technological innovation, social transformation and individual experience. What is art today? What are their sources? When appreciating art, a follow-up question is necessary: is this ready-made, or product of mechanic replication. Next, art could be sought after in medium, or the transient moment of aura, just as proposed by Benjamin.\n    Conceptual Art and Relational Aesthetics\n    According to Wikipedia definition (Chinese version), in conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work while tangible representation is not as important. A famous inference made by artist Sol LeWitt says that:\n    The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.\n    This symbolizes the depreciation of handcraft in heydays of industrialization and beckons the dawning of an era when information is a means of production.\n    The notion of relational aesthetics explores the artistic foundation among human beings and its ubiquitous extension that coves everything, which becomes clues to creation of “Human and Nonhuman” as later summarized by Pierre Huyghe. \n    Intellection emancipated human beings from labor. In an IT era, art is moving from a concrete creation to spiritual existence. Another storyline as a matter of fact is indeed governed by materialized reality. Anything that could become materialized media for transaction and communication is dominated by concepts just as Sol LeWitt and Lawrence Weiner’s wordplay, or traded manuscripts and texts, and any medium with traces, either in an art gallery or on building facades. Isn’t it counterevidence to values of materials and handicrafts prevailing concepts? Concepts find nowhere to exist for their uncertainty or their changing with the times and semantics when people are reading and trying to understand graphics with inertia.\n    Is relational aesthetics a continuation of conceptual art? Temporally maybe. The art of intertextuality might be even closer with relational aesthetics as they are relatively uniform in movement and interaction, paradigm of transformation, or work presentation which is the directional end. A group of later artists represented by Pierre Huyghe are more inclined to the concept of transient art, thus breaking intrinsic temporal barriers for conceptual art, art of intertextuality or art of the past. From the perspective of Live in Your Head – When Attitudes Become Form, characteristics of material transformation, performance, interactivity, new medialization in temporally-consequential material results are all attributed to a tendency that has not been defined yet in spite of its prevalence in more artistic creations.\n    This is a paradox of this epoch. When we are still talking about consciousness and extension unified by the conventional aesthetic system of paintings, sculptures and video recordings, we can’t afford to ignore the consequence of conceptual and technical intervention in light of modernity. New artistic tastes composed of mechanical, high-tech and fluorescent super materials are indeed being increasingly accepted by emerging art markets and artistic institution. This is credited to the governance of an emerging IT revolution when technological iteration is on the heels of industrial revolution. All that is possibly connected, from handicraft to mindset, could be part of deep learning and intelligence for the future, whereas the interchange of material in creation keeps its due circulation models and patterns as from barter trade to money transaction.\n    The paradox for conceptual art and relational aesthetics naturally points to the rupture between material and non-material in visual experience or knowledge accumulation due to the agnostic nature of intellection. Iteration of wide social topics in a contemporary context is naturally incorporated and restructured.\n    What should we think about the mobility of existential time, the environment and culture?\n    \n    Nostalgia in Modernity\n    What are people referring to when talking about nostalgia? Virtual economies that are moving super fast and super real, or land and houses for subsistence? What is a better future and present? Nostalgia is human nature and a newly-discovered element in collective unconsciousness. Mobility of the world, knowledge and people leads to abandoning the possibility of making interventions in and having discussions of the present, and to a shortage of responsibilities for the future. Accepting present is a must-do for the sake of survival. Modernity is not static and life itself resides only in passing moments. How should people intervene into the formation of today’s world?\n    As Duchamp and Benjamin were both fugitives of their times, is there any connection between mobility and knowledge production? How to pierce through objects to grasp its essence? When flowers are not flowers and fog is not fog, every existence has to transform itself. A home belonging to the past and a past never called back provide better understanding of knowledge expanded by mobility. How to understand survival under the impact of modernity and the dilemma of human existence in modern productive relations still wait to be answered. As predicted by Kevin Kelly in The Inevitable that it is not competitions between human beings that push high unemployment because labor forces and the identity of laborer are being replaced and stolen by machines. The rivalry between human and machine or AI is gradually influencing how groups in society are structured. Mobility spreads diseases and environmental pollution, and blends cultures together. Is this an omen to the end of the previous social model?\n    Where did people come from and where are they going? What is not the hometown might be a hometown. Warmth might be felt more easily in a present world.\n    \n    Materialization\n    The sum of all recognizable human behaviors, materials and non-materials might be the concept mentioned by Daniel in his narrative of materialization. It is not restricted to the conversion of thinking and concept by material but about accumulation which is both unstable and uncertain. He intentionally separates this form of art from sculptures, paintings or installations. Rather than defining his creations and works within Dadaism, conceptual art, art of intertextuality or relational aesthetics, he thinks more about constantly-changing forms in integrated temporal clues and issues in super-fast society, as well as potential consequences of openness.\n    Powder created in 1994 implies characteristics of relational aesthetics. Performing elements are involved such as exhibits (cocaine) confiscated by the police station and policemen on duty; patterns in powder, primitive impulses and protection with bullet-proof glass; real scene and secondary media coverage. His habits are similar to streaming media today as their focuses and works are constantly adapting and transforming themselves. With spectators and researchers feeling perplexed like engulfed by heavy fog, it is hard to have a focus when carriers of the work keep changing themselves. Originality of the work concept is also shifting, ceaselessly generating different intersections on a timeline. The only thing that could be traced reversely is time. Between the past and future, there are dots of condensation that form consistency in movement studied in photography or configurations of passes in games. Besides, if overlapped media are peeled away, there are factors of graphics in design media, confiscate spoils, reaction of real spectators, and social service providers in police station and exhibition room.\n    European Influenza by Daniel was in Romanian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2005 with a huge empty space created. Together with texts collected by exhibitors that could never be finished, everything points to history and present. A backdoor was left open for visitors to run away. Since the exhibition hall is directly connected to a garden through the backdoor, such an open structure responds to the existential paradox of National Pavilion and the smartness of lucky artists and artistic institution. What will spectators and researchers see here? What are their feelings? Will they run away through the backdoor? The artist creating detachment in addition when this Biennale has already become a globalized epitome of neo-liberalism left spectators in extreme emptiness.\n    There might be spectators who read texts prepared by exhibitors to understand more about modern history of Europe; perhaps some are blessed with sudden enlightenment in emptiness; or this Pavilion is merely nothing more than a passable corridor; or these are possibly all consequences of Daniel’s design. Has an artist reversed your opinions on art? Inside the co-existence of creation and dissipation, passages and passengers are only for entering or exiting. One might dwell upon an individual and a country, one nation and many of them, or a beholding seen by spectators without visual experience of an exhibition. Perhaps visitors from a certain artistic field call it conceptual art, or have different feelings inside or outside the Pavilion. They move from multiple exhibitions to a natural garden, to see plants or oceans.\n    Daniel’s Expiration Movement was located on top of the Fridericianum in 2017 Documenta Kassel, with white smoke bellowing out to connect with clouds. Events triggered by individuals, smoke performances, public reactions and variable forms of the work all lead to the meet with contingency. Later when Daniel presented his work, he referred to a huge number of online pictures in which the form of his work together with composition, color and narration endowed by communication made its message eternal with the help of communication effect of the Internet. Placing the picture inside a gallery hall for exhibition is reproduction or archaeology by new media, sparking further reflection upon existence and emptiness, existence and time, existence and media.\n    What have artists created? What are artists adapting to or facing as challenges in mobile concepts and media overlapping?\n    By Li Zhenhua",planner_des:{curator:"curator",curator_name:"",exhibition_series:"Exhibition Series",exhibition_series_title:"",QR_code:"QRcode.png"},related_exhibitions:[{index:1,content_title:"九层塔：空间与视觉的魔术",time:"2021.3.28-6.20",warning_content:{level:"PAM-warning-color-1",content:"On Now"},element:null,rows:1},{index:2,content_title:"共时｜坪山美术馆2019 年度大展",time:"2021.3.28-6.20",warning_content:{level:"PAM-warning-color-2",content:"Ends Soon"},element:null,current_row:1},{index:3,content_title:"九层塔：空间与视觉的魔术",time:"2021.3.28-6.20",element:null,current_row:1}]}},2917:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t["default"]={title:"Portraiting Pingshan",subtitle:"",author:"鲁明军",cover_imageurl:"exhibitionsContent2020-2_img1.jpg",time:"2020.8.22-10.9",content:'The exhibition "Portraiting Pingshan—Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Establishment of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone" hosted by the Publicity Department of the CPC Pingshan District Committee of Shenzhen and Culture, Broadcast and Television, Tourism and Sports Bureau of Pingshan District, undertaken by Pingshan Art Museum, was kicked off at the outdoor plaza of Pingshan Art Museum on August 22.\n    For the exhibition "Portraiting Pingshan—Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Establishment of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone", Pingshan Art Museum invites artist Liu Qingyuan to create portraits based on citizens that have been participating in the development of Pingshan.

   杜尚的艺术探索是非图像多物质的，探讨现成品美感和众多拼合的物件累加，艺术不再是图 像上的叙事、色彩、构图等线索下的审美观念，艺术从其固有的线索脱离出来。仅仅作为物质（性）的存在，是反思现在的凭借物，并为思考当代为何物提供视觉经验，这也可以被看作是1969年泽曼策划的「当态度成为形式: 活在你的脑中」的密切联系。\n    本雅明所支持的关于视觉经验的技术议题，技术介入后的艺术的原创性和可复制性的张力，也为之后马克卢汉「媒介即讯息」开辟了道路。而理解1900年之后艺术、技术、审美、社会变迁，也就必然的要回到具体的艺术家和物质，理念和技术创新，社会变化和个体经验的诸多张力中去探讨，今天的艺术是什么？以及那些艺术的来源。也必须在观看的时候追问，这是不是现成品，这是不是机器复制的产物。然后再问艺术存于介质，或如本雅明所提“灵光”之一瞬。\n    观念艺术和关系美学\n    “观念艺术作品重要的部分是其概念，而有形的表现并不重要。艺术家索尔·勒维特曾有过著名的论断：“观念是创造艺术作品的机器”；这标志了工业化最繁盛时期的手工艺贬值，以及信息作为生产手段的时代的到来。”——维基词条\n    在“关系美学”探讨的介于人与人之间的艺术基础，以及其庞大到万事万物，后被皮埃尔•于热归为“人和非人”的创作线索。\n    思维让人从劳动中解放，而科技信息时代的到来，让艺术也从艺术的具体创造，走向更精神性的存在。而事实的另一个主线，确是被物质化的现实所统治，任何观念所主导的，都成为可以交易、传播的具体化介质，如索尔•勒维特或劳伦斯•维纳的文字游戏，或在美术馆，或在建筑物的外立面，或他们被交易的手稿、文本，以及任何有着痕迹的介质，这些不都在反证物质和手工艺的价值大于观念？或是人阅读信息和理解图像的惯性，观念因其不确定而存之无处，或伴随时代变迁，语意延展。\n    关系美学是否是观念艺术的延续？时间上有着上下文的关系，或许互文艺术和关系美学接得更紧密一些，因其运动、交互的特性，其转化的具体的点（范式），或其指向的终点——作品化，是相对统一的。这在之后一群艺术家，为首的皮埃尔•于热更倾向于“稍纵即逝的艺术”这一理念。观念艺术、互文艺术或过去艺术所固有的时间维度，被突破了。时间所连带的物质性结果从「当态度成为形式:活在你的脑中」这一线索看，其包含的物性转化、表演性、交互性、新媒介化等等特征，都在归于一个还未曾被下定义的倾向，却在越来越多的艺术家创作中越来越普遍。\n    这是这个时代存在的悖论，我们依旧在讨论绘画、雕塑、录像等已经被传统审美系统所统一的意识及其延续，不能忽略现代性介入后，观念和技术介入的结果。而机械的、高科技的、荧光色和超级材料构成的新艺术趣味，确实也在新兴的艺术市场和艺术体制更多被接受。而这正是工业革命之后，技术带来的迭代，是新兴科技信息革命统治下的结果。一切可能被连接的，从手工艺到思维，都有可能构成深度学习和未来智能的组成部分。而关于创造的物质交换，也依旧保持着从人类创造以物易物到货币，其应该有的流转方式和模样。\n    观念艺术和关系美学存在的悖论，因思维之于人的不可知，也就自然的指向了视觉体验或知识构建的物质和非物质的撕裂，当代话题中所包含的更广泛的社会议题之迭代，也自然的被引入其中，并重新构建。\n    人如何思考其存在的时间、环境和文化之流动。\n    现代性中的乡愁\n    高速移动的和超真实的虚拟经济体，以及生存所凭借的土地、房屋等，人在谈论乡愁的时候，她在谈论什么？什么是更好的未来和现在？人总会怀念过去的好时光。怀旧是新的集体无意识，因世界、知识和人都是流动的，放弃了介入和讨论现在的可能性，以及缺乏对未来的责任感，而接受现在也是生存的必须。现代性并非一成不变，而生活本身也在瞬息间。人应该如何介入到今日世界的形成？\n    杜尚和本雅明都是其时代的逃亡者，流动性和知识生产是否有联系？如何认识到事物的本质。花非花、雾非雾，不也正好赋予了“一切存在的都必须转型”吗？回不去的过去和家，让人能更好的理解移动带来的认知拓展，如何理解现代性冲击下的生存，如何理解现代性生产关系下，人存在的困境。劳动力和劳动者的身份被替代，如凯文•凯利「必然」中所言，并非人和人的竞争导致了失业率攀升，人和机器、Ai的竞争正在逐渐影响到社会人群的构建方式。流动性带来的疾病、环境污染、文化交融等等，是否也会是上一个社会模型终结之前兆？\n    物化\n    所有能被识别的人类行为、物质和非物质的总和。这大概是丹尼尔在其表述中所提及的概念，物质化，并不仅仅是物质对思想、概念的转化，而是在其上的累加，并有其不稳定和不确定之指向，他特意将这类型的艺术区别于其他，如雕塑、绘画、装置等。丹尼尔并不完全将其创作限定在达达主义、观念艺术、互文艺术、关系美学的脉络中，而是更多考虑一直统合在时间线索下，以及超高速的社会议题中，不断变化的形态，以及开放的可能遭遇的结果。\n    1994年其创作的「粉末」，其中隐含着的“关系美学”特征，涉及到的表演性因素，从警察局的证物（可卡因）到现场站岗的警察；粉末上的刻画，原始冲动和防弹玻璃的保护；现实场景和二次媒体报道。丹尼尔有着类似于今天流媒体特征的习惯，其专注和作品都在不间断的适应转型。从而让观者和研究者如坠雾中，作品所依存的凭借物在不断延展的过程中，无法聚焦。作品观念的原初性，也在不断的转移中，不间断的生成不同时间点的交叉。唯一可以被逆向追踪的就是时间，发生在过去和未来之间，有着一个个不同的点状凝结，构成了一个摄影术中研究运动的连续，或游戏中每个关卡的设定。除此之外，不断叠加的还有媒介，层层剥除媒介，设计传媒的图像、法外之物、现实观众的反应、从警察局到展厅的社会服务者等等因素。\n    2005年威尼斯双年展罗马尼亚国家馆，丹尼尔创作了「欧洲流感」，一个巨大空洞的空间，和策展人收集的根本无法完全阅读的文本，一切都是指向历史和现在的，而观众可以选择逃走，展厅的后门直通花园，恰是这个开放的结构，回应了国家馆的存在悖论，以及艺术家和艺术体制侥幸的机智。如观者和研究者，会在这里看到什么？体会到什么？会选择从后门走掉吗？这个早已是全球化和新自由主义缩影的双年展，一个艺术家能在添加的时候，出离。\n    并将来看艺术的人，置于极端的空无中。\n    或许有人阅读了策展人准备的文本，对欧洲近代历史有所知晓；或许在空无中，有人顿悟；或许这个展厅不过是一个可穿过的通道；或许这些都是丹尼尔设计的可能的结果之一。艺术家逆转了你的艺术的看法吗？创造和消解的并存，过客和过道的应景，仅仅是进与出，思考一个人和国家，一个国家和众多国家，一个被看却没有展览视觉经验的观看。也许一个艺术领域的观众，会说这是观念艺术，也许在展厅中、展厅外会有不一样的感触。从众多展览到自然的花园，看植物或大海。\n

置于弗里德里希阿鲁门博物馆的最高点，滚滚白烟与云连接着。个体触发的事件，烟雾的表演性，公众的反应，以及作品多变的形态——遭遇偶然性。丹尼尔在之后呈现作品时，引用了大量来自网络的图片，图片中其作品的形态，和被传播所赋予的构图、色彩、叙事，也在借助着互联网的传播效应，让这件作品的信息永生。丹尼尔将图片再次置入美术馆展厅时，是再现，也是新媒体考古的引入，让人遭遇时再思，存在和虚无，存在和时间，存在和媒介等等问题？\n

is different from traditional solo exhibitions of architects as it does not display models, drawings and renderings as usual. Instead, it presents another clue offered by Architect Yung Ho Chang. Through the space design and installations, the playground of “perspective” and “seeing” is thereby established.","As the most important architect in China, Yung Ho Chang has not only designed many eye-catching architectural works, but also participated in a large number of art exhibitions and theoretical studies with a complex system of his own, covering from the changes in Asian urbanization to the experimentation of exhibition construction. The driving force for the development of this system lies in the architect's broad vision and diversified exploration. He constantly returns to the starting point of architecture, reflecting on and reconstructing all basic elements, thus opening up the possibility to re-understand architecture.","The five installations in the exhibition of “Looking for” are presenting a brief history of perspective. The work begins with the experiment regarding linear perspective carried out in the 14th century by Italian Architect Filippo Brunelleschi who pioneered the era of constructing spaces with scientific methods. It is the beginning of the entire exhibition and also a metaphor for Yung Ho Chang’s working routines. Here, he has paved a way for us to look for “perspective”.","Down the journey led by Yung Ho Chang, we can look for the one-point perspective created by the Architect Andrea Palladio in the 16th century and the complicated experience of abstract urban spaces in current days; we can take a guess about the camera obscura used by Vermeer when he painted in the 17th century; we can learn from the Painter Kazimir Malevich in the early 20th century to create 6 rotatable viewfinders; we can also find the perspective relationship between windows, rooms, and furniture in the movie “Rear Window” produced by Alfred Hitchcock, and create a brand new “Window” thereof.","Pieces in “Looking for” have formed a space game pointing to the history of the architecture itself with the imagination of the possibility for perspective. In the game, the time and space created by architects and artists from different eras have never been interrupted. They're mixed together, with no distinction between ancient and modern, the past and the present.","In other words, “Looking for” has intercepted a static experience through precise construction, designing multiple channels for “seeing”, which makes originally abstract motion clear and concrete. We complete the process of discovery by “seeing”, which, in turn, is merged with here.","But these five works are different from traditional architecture as they are creating a  pure spatial game and experiment. “Looking for” brings us back to the root of architecture by removing the practicality and theme, returning to the core elements that form the theme. That being said, these “installations” are not models, nor are they tools and paths for the construction. They exist independently, with their own order, destination and meaning.","However, these installations are not entirely “art” either, for they are rationally designed rather than merely imagined. They're derived from the pursuit for knowledge starting from perspective studies in the Enlightenment. Everything about perspective needs to be recorded, so the means of description must be accurate. They are not “painted” or “carved”, but calculated. It is the accurate means and tightly knitted creation and verification that endow these works with purposes, functions and meanings completely different from artistic creations (perspective in installations, sculptures, paintings).","Yung Ho Chang travels through movies, paintings, and architectures of various eras, looking for a space experience that can stand out from traditional perspectives, and seeking ways to design time through space. How should time be spent and where should it travel through? “Looking for” has become the intermediate zone between architecture and art, inspiring people to think about space, self, and existence in a different way during the exploration of the space consciousness in the human world."],planner_des:{curator:"curator",curator_name:"Cui Cancan ",exhibition_series:"Exhibition Series",exhibition_series_title:"Perspectival Playground",QR_code:"QRcode.png"},related_exhibitions:[{index:1,content_title:"Beyond Social Text: Duo Solo Exhibition of Li Mingchang and Zhang Jinhui",time:"2021.3.28-6.20",warning_content:{level:"PAM-warning-color-1",content:"On Now"},background_image:{show:!1,url:"exhibitions_img_1.png"},element:null,rows:1},{index:2,content_title:"Beyond Social Text: Duo Solo Exhibition of Li Mingchang and Zhang Jinhui",time:"2021.3.28-6.20",warning_content:{level:"PAM-warning-color-2",content:"Ends Soon"},element:null,current_row:1},{index:3,content_title:"Beyond Social Text: Duo Solo Exhibition of Li Mingchang and Zhang Jinhui",time:"2021.3.28-6.20",element:null,current_row:1}]}},"5e53":function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t["default"]={title:"故乡系列之二｜王子耕《1994年》",subtitle:"",author:"王子耕",cover_imageurl:"exhibitionsContent2021-4_img1.jpg",time:"2021.10.24",content:["2021年10月24日，由深圳市坪山区文化广电旅游体育局主办、坪山美术馆承办的“故乡系列之二｜王子耕《1994年》项目发布会在坪山美术馆举办。","本次项目发布会由坪山美术馆馆长刘晓都主持，邀请建筑师、艺术家王子耕围绕作品《1994年》分享近期的实践及思考，同时邀请《艺术新闻/中文版》《艺术界LEAP》出版人曹丹、《打边炉》主编钟刚、设计互联总监赵蓉、建筑师与策展人张宇星作为对谈嘉宾，就建筑师的跨领域实验、个人叙事、场景记忆与社会关系展开研讨，挖掘深圳背景下的故乡与他乡的关联和精神衍义。","刘晓都馆长在致辞中表示：装置作品《1994年》是坪山美术馆“故乡系列”品牌项目邀请建筑师王子耕在坪山的特别呈现。装置《1994年》先后在OCAT上海馆及北京山中天艺术中心有过展示，在深圳是第三站、也是最完整的一次呈现。","故乡系列的首展是在北京的艺术家海波以摄影为主要媒介的个展，一场关于海波与他的东北家乡的创作回顾。我们希望通过故乡系列的展览，在深圳这样的移民城市，去追溯和挖掘故乡与他乡之间的关系。","王子耕的创作历程，也与他的生命经验和记忆有关。通过回溯童年与父亲生活的经历，和与他现在跨越时空交流，相信在子耕的呈现下，会使“故乡系列”产生不一样的张力。","设计互联总监赵蓉表示：每一个艺术家都在构建自己的观看方式，呈现在我们面前的是王子耕的尝试。这个作品给人的感觉是孤独的，我们可以发现盒子里面有相邻的两个空间，两边的人永远不会见面，这边打开，那边就会闭合，通过手摇、通过机械原理创造了反射的做法。作为建筑师，王子耕把自己的回忆创建在这样一个有戏剧感的盒子里，这是他尝试建构自我的过程。","值得探讨的是，他在尝试用建筑化的语言在艺术装置和建筑装置之间产生关联。当我们在讨论建筑设计可能性的时候，讨论日常公共空间的设计的时候，我们可以思考，从过往的经验出发，还可以创造什么样的叙事连接的方法。","在钟刚看来，《1994》虽然有很多功能上的设置和参数上的考量，但它打动人的地方就是外在朴素的形式和作品传递出来的细腻情感。黑色的装置，一个有年代感的车厢，所指向是一段父子共处的时间和空间，是一个纪念碑性的、有重量感和体积感的黑色物质。这个作品既是王子耕对父亲的纪念，也是1980年代人最不愿意去触碰的记忆，关乎亲情，关乎成长。成长于改革开放和消费时代的这一代，有很多被忽略和遮蔽的个人叙事，这是在政治和经济夹缝当中成长起来的一代，从这个层面上讲，这既是一个黑色的纪念碑，也是一段被遮蔽的时间装置的开启。","这个项目属于坪山美术馆的故乡系列，这个系列在深圳推出也非常有意思，深圳是一个“来了就是深圳人”的城市，但大家在来深之前的过去，他的故乡，他的成长，他的“怎样的过去”塑造了他在深圳的今天，反而没有被关注，这个系列建立在人的丰富性和多向度的基础上，是一个值得开垦和持续推进的、有温度的展览系列，非常值得继续期待。","张宇星在现场分享中，从精神分析的角度对王子耕的创作进行了解读，张宇星从本我、自我和超我三个维度，分析王子耕的作品呈现的身体对安全感的渴望、现代世界中生活与机器媒介的互为支配关系、以及创造性工作带来的类似平行宇宙般的超越与惊奇，最后对王子耕的作品所体现的真诚勇气与情感能量表示感佩。","曹丹把王子耕的《1994年》读解为记忆的列车和时间的暗箱：“我更感兴趣的是关于父亲的主题，这个经历可能带着遗憾、误解和失落，在这个过程中很重要的部分是艺术家可能通过作品实现与自己的和解。我看到子耕内涵着致敬父亲的情绪，这个带有纪念碑性的作品可能随着子耕在不同展览里面的深化带来跟父亲的和解与精神交流。”"],planner_des:{curator:"curator",curator_name:"",exhibition_series:"Exhibition Series",exhibition_series_title:"",QR_code:"QRcode.png"},related_exhibitions:[{index:1,content_title:"九层塔：空间与视觉的魔术",time:"2021.3.28-6.20",warning_content:{level:"PAM-warning-color-1",content:"On Now"},element:null,rows:1},{index:2,content_title:"共时｜坪山美术馆2019 年度大展",time:"2021.3.28-6.20",warning_content:{level:"PAM-warning-color-2",content:"Ends Soon"},element:null,current_row:1},{index:3,content_title:"九层塔：空间与视觉的魔术",time:"2021.3.28-6.20",element:null,current_row:1}]}},"5f4a":function(e,t,n){"use strict";n("32c6")},"67b6":function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t["default"]={title:"AURA",subtitle:"",author:"Daniel Knorr",cover_imageurl:"exhibitionsContent2021-5_img1.jpg",time:"2021.10.24",content:"\n    Duchamp and Benjamin\n    *Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968) / Walter Benjamin (1892-1940)\n    From ready-made to dissipation of aura, was the theorist Walter Benjamin during the WWI and WWII under the influence of artist Marcel Duchamp and Zürich Dadaism? Both living a drifting life, two artists and intellectuals had very special representations and interpretations of modernity and its induced changes. Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain and Walter Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction could both be taken as important turning points for conceptual and technical art to universal aesthetic experience in society. Following Fountain and Dadaism are thoughts and practices of conceptual art, concept of ready-made, installation art, minimalism and Arte Povera. In the days after The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, photography as a form of art set the foundation for the rising new media art and made those engaged in art work reflect on authenticity and narration in graphics and the existence of aesthetic forms.\n    Being non-graphic and tilting towards materials, Duchamp’s art explored the beauty of ready-made and cumulative patchworks. Art is no longer an aesthetic concept of graphic narration, color and composition. This freed art from intrinsic clues and made it merely a material existence, or a means to reflect upon the present, providing visual experience to support the pondering over what is contemporary. It could also been regarded as a close connection as in Live in Your Head – When Attitudes Become Form, a show curated by Harald Szeeman in 1969.\n    The technology issue in visual experience as supported by Benjamin, and the tension from artistic originality and replicability when technology intervenes pioneered Marshall Mcluhan’s Media is the Message. To understand art, technology, aesthetics and social changes after 1900, it is necessary to return to tensions between specific artists and materials, concepts and technological innovation, social transformation and individual experience. What is art today? What are their sources? When appreciating art, a follow-up question is necessary: is this ready-made, or product of mechanic replication. Next, art could be sought after in medium, or the transient moment of aura, just as proposed by Benjamin.\n    Conceptual Art and Relational Aesthetics\n    According to Wikipedia definition (Chinese version), in conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work while tangible representation is not as important. A famous inference made by artist Sol LeWitt says that:\n    The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.\n    This symbolizes the depreciation of handcraft in heydays of industrialization and beckons the dawning of an era when information is a means of production.\n    The notion of relational aesthetics explores the artistic foundation among human beings and its ubiquitous extension that coves everything, which becomes clues to creation of “Human and Nonhuman” as later summarized by Pierre Huyghe. \n    Intellection emancipated human beings from labor. In an IT era, art is moving from a concrete creation to spiritual existence. Another storyline as a matter of fact is indeed governed by materialized reality. Anything that could become materialized media for transaction and communication is dominated by concepts just as Sol LeWitt and Lawrence Weiner’s wordplay, or traded manuscripts and texts, and any medium with traces, either in an art gallery or on building facades. Isn’t it counterevidence to values of materials and handicrafts prevailing concepts? Concepts find nowhere to exist for their uncertainty or their changing with the times and semantics when people are reading and trying to understand graphics with inertia.\n    Is relational aesthetics a continuation of conceptual art? Temporally maybe. The art of intertextuality might be even closer with relational aesthetics as they are relatively uniform in movement and interaction, paradigm of transformation, or work presentation which is the directional end. A group of later artists represented by Pierre Huyghe are more inclined to the concept of transient art, thus breaking intrinsic temporal barriers for conceptual art, art of intertextuality or art of the past. From the perspective of Live in Your Head – When Attitudes Become Form, characteristics of material transformation, performance, interactivity, new medialization in temporally-consequential material results are all attributed to a tendency that has not been defined yet in spite of its prevalence in more artistic creations.\n    This is a paradox of this epoch. When we are still talking about consciousness and extension unified by the conventional aesthetic system of paintings, sculptures and video recordings, we can’t afford to ignore the consequence of conceptual and technical intervention in light of modernity. New artistic tastes composed of mechanical, high-tech and fluorescent super materials are indeed being increasingly accepted by emerging art markets and artistic institution. This is credited to the governance of an emerging IT revolution when technological iteration is on the heels of industrial revolution. All that is possibly connected, from handicraft to mindset, could be part of deep learning and intelligence for the future, whereas the interchange of material in creation keeps its due circulation models and patterns as from barter trade to money transaction.\n    The paradox for conceptual art and relational aesthetics naturally points to the rupture between material and non-material in visual experience or knowledge accumulation due to the agnostic nature of intellection. Iteration of wide social topics in a contemporary context is naturally incorporated and restructured.\n    What should we think about the mobility of existential time, the environment and culture?\n    \n    Nostalgia in Modernity\n    What are people referring to when talking about nostalgia? Virtual economies that are moving super fast and super real, or land and houses for subsistence? What is a better future and present? Nostalgia is human nature and a newly-discovered element in collective unconsciousness. Mobility of the world, knowledge and people leads to abandoning the possibility of making interventions in and having discussions of the present, and to a shortage of responsibilities for the future. Accepting present is a must-do for the sake of survival. Modernity is not static and life itself resides only in passing moments. How should people intervene into the formation of today’s world?\n    As Duchamp and Benjamin were both fugitives of their times, is there any connection between mobility and knowledge production? How to pierce through objects to grasp its essence? When flowers are not flowers and fog is not fog, every existence has to transform itself. A home belonging to the past and a past never called back provide better understanding of knowledge expanded by mobility. How to understand survival under the impact of modernity and the dilemma of human existence in modern productive relations still wait to be answered. As predicted by Kevin Kelly in The Inevitable that it is not competitions between human beings that push high unemployment because labor forces and the identity of laborer are being replaced and stolen by machines. The rivalry between human and machine or AI is gradually influencing how groups in society are structured. Mobility spreads diseases and environmental pollution, and blends cultures together. Is this an omen to the end of the previous social model?\n    Where did people come from and where are they going? What is not the hometown might be a hometown. Warmth might be felt more easily in a present world.\n    \n    Materialization\n    The sum of all recognizable human behaviors, materials and non-materials might be the concept mentioned by Daniel in his narrative of materialization. It is not restricted to the conversion of thinking and concept by material but about accumulation which is both unstable and uncertain. He intentionally separates this form of art from sculptures, paintings or installations. Rather than defining his creations and works within Dadaism, conceptual art, art of intertextuality or relational aesthetics, he thinks more about constantly-changing forms in integrated temporal clues and issues in super-fast society, as well as potential consequences of openness.\n    Powder created in 1994 implies characteristics of relational aesthetics. Performing elements are involved such as exhibits (cocaine) confiscated by the police station and policemen on duty; patterns in powder, primitive impulses and protection with bullet-proof glass; real scene and secondary media coverage. His habits are similar to streaming media today as their focuses and works are constantly adapting and transforming themselves. With spectators and researchers feeling perplexed like engulfed by heavy fog, it is hard to have a focus when carriers of the work keep changing themselves. Originality of the work concept is also shifting, ceaselessly generating different intersections on a timeline. The only thing that could be traced reversely is time. Between the past and future, there are dots of condensation that form consistency in movement studied in photography or configurations of passes in games. Besides, if overlapped media are peeled away, there are factors of graphics in design media, confiscate spoils, reaction of real spectators, and social service providers in police station and exhibition room.\n    European Influenza by Daniel was in Romanian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2005 with a huge empty space created. Together with texts collected by exhibitors that could never be finished, everything points to history and present. A backdoor was left open for visitors to run away. Since the exhibition hall is directly connected to a garden through the backdoor, such an open structure responds to the existential paradox of National Pavilion and the smartness of lucky artists and artistic institution. What will spectators and researchers see here? What are their feelings? Will they run away through the backdoor? The artist creating detachment in addition when this Biennale has already become a globalized epitome of neo-liberalism left spectators in extreme emptiness.\n    There might be spectators who read texts prepared by exhibitors to understand more about modern history of Europe; perhaps some are blessed with sudden enlightenment in emptiness; or this Pavilion is merely nothing more than a passable corridor; or these are possibly all consequences of Daniel’s design. Has an artist reversed your opinions on art? Inside the co-existence of creation and dissipation, passages and passengers are only for entering or exiting. One might dwell upon an individual and a country, one nation and many of them, or a beholding seen by spectators without visual experience of an exhibition. Perhaps visitors from a certain artistic field call it conceptual art, or have different feelings inside or outside the Pavilion. They move from multiple exhibitions to a natural garden, to see plants or oceans.\n    Daniel’s Expiration Movement was located on top of the Fridericianum in 2017 Documenta Kassel, with white smoke bellowing out to connect with clouds. Events triggered by individuals, smoke performances, public reactions and variable forms of the work all lead to the meet with contingency.

Akomfrah）将目光投向了这段历史。在影片《谟涅摩绪涅》（Mnemosyne，2010）中，他沿着但丁、贝克特、狄金森、 乔伊斯、弥尔顿、尼采、莎士比亚、索福克勒斯和托马斯等所铺就的诗学路径， 融移民的视频档案与白雪皑皑的阿拉斯加雪景于一体，重述了一段群体迁移史。 \n在希腊神话里，谟涅摩绪涅是主司记忆、语言、文字的女神，亦常被称为“记忆女神”。据赫西俄德《神谱》记载，谟涅摩绪涅是乌拉诺斯和盖亚之女，和宙斯结合生下了九位缪斯。那么亚康法影片中的但丁、贝克特等所对应的或许正是九位缪斯，它们共同谱写了一曲有关迁徙和旅途、记忆和哀悼、知识和身份、自然与政治的“悲伤之歌”。如果说谟涅摩绪涅是它们的源头的话，那么在这一穿越 神话、传说、历史及种种无形物的想象之旅中，迁变的“缪斯”则在不断地唤醒个人的遭遇和群体之记忆。\n1992 年，一位来自澳洲的白人贾斯汀·特卡钦科德（Justin Tkatchenkode）则移民巴布亚新几内亚（简称“巴新”）。在其加入巴新国籍后短短的十多年间，原始部落为主的巴新逐渐进入了世界的舞台。也是在这个过程中，特卡钦科德克 \n服种种阻力，成功地当选为巴新国土部部长，且深受原始部落民众的认可和拥戴。 方迪的新作《部长》便以非虚构的方式记录了这位白人部长在巴新的“发迹史”。《部长》和《谟涅摩绪涅》看似是两个没有任何关系的作品，但若放在一起，似 乎构成了一个“镜像”关系。\n巧合的是，“缪斯”也是龚剑新画的名字。这一系列画作描绘的是曾经混迹艺术 圈和上流社会的德国超级名媛安娜·德尔维（Anna Delvey）的生活片段，包括 因诈骗罪被拘捕的现场。据媒体报道，这位浑身上下奢侈品、随时出入高级社交场所、张口就是上亿项目的德国“超级白富美”原来是一普通的俄罗斯移民，本 名叫安娜·索罗金（Anna Sorokin）。在古希腊神话中，缪斯是主司艺术与科学 的九位古老文艺女神的总称，她常常出现在众神或英雄们的聚会上，轻歌曼舞，一展风采，为聚会带来愉悦与欢乐。龚剑将索罗金假想为当代的缪斯，但此画的 目的显然不是渎神，也不是反讽，而只是想传递一个荒诞的现实，或者说荒诞就 是现实本身。索罗金的传奇经历无疑是当下时代最恰切的表征，说它是一个神话， 一点也不为过。\n与亚康法几乎同时，新加坡艺术家何子彦在影片《无知之云》（2011)中书写 了一部同样震慑人心的史诗。影像由8个片段组成，卡拉瓦乔、苏巴朗、克雷乔、贝尼尼、曼特尼亚、玛格利特等这些艺术史上的经典是他的母本，受法国艺术史家于贝尔·达弥施（Hubert Damisch)名著《云的理论：为了建立一种新 的绘画史》的启发，这里每一个片段的主人公都是云的化身。和亚康法作品中的荷马、但丁、弥尔顿等一样，何子彦影片中的卡拉瓦乔、苏巴朗、克雷乔也是 一种象征。透过云的视角，达弥施开启了一个去象征化的绘画史叙述句法，何子彦援引这一视角和句法，一方面是重返殖民史背景下弥漫在东南亚的复杂认同，另一方面也是在暗示殖民本身还具有一种不可见的暴力，即一种无边无形，但又 交织着爱与恨、善与恶等种种荒诞、诡异、神秘而又蛊惑人心的情感与体验。\n传说\n1939年12月，应印度诗人泰戈尔之邀，徐悲鸿前往圣地尼克坦。次年2月，甘地访问尼克坦时，泰戈尔向甘地引见了徐悲鸿。徐悲鸿被甘地为争取民族独立解 放所作的抗争所感动，加之此时国内抗战正酣，两位一见如故，共情于反殖民、反帝国的运动与斗争。在短暂的相处中，徐悲鸿看到了甘地身上愚公一般的精神。 他不仅为甘地画像，还特意创作了《愚公移山》。\n“愚公移山”的传说我们并不陌生。画面描绘的是一个凝聚着力量的和谐场景， 中人物不分国籍民族，不分男女老幼，共同在迈向一个遥远的目标。作为两个民族和文明的象征，强壮而聪慧的大象是印度人最喜爱的动物，耕牛则是中国最普遍、也是最具韧性和意志的动物劳力之一。\n2016年，即抗战胜利70年后，艺术家杨福东以徐悲鸿的《愚公移山》为母本，重述了这个古老的传说。影片中穿梭着几位西装革履的现代知识分子或现代雇主， 他们与赤裸上身的劳作者之间形成了极大的反差，二者之间的疏离像是两个时代 的相遇和不可融合的重叠，亦仿佛是两个不可调和的阶层。意味深长的是，影片的尾声，一个衣装整齐的现代都市青年猛然从浴缸中抬起头来，像是获得了清洗，又像是突然梦醒。影像关注的与其说是人在自然面前的无助、无奈和无力，不如说是人的毅力、韧性和意志，即如何透过现代的视角思考“坚持”这种精神。就 像他说的：“小时候我们只学会了‘坚持’的道理，也没有太多对‘坚持’的思考。就好像我们在小时候有很多理想和憧憬，长大却不敢去想了，殊不知很多我们认 为美好的东西是跟理想、跟憧憬息息相关的。进而能够让我积极地面对生活。”\n也是在这一年，年轻的艺术家褚秉超孤身前往家乡甘肃平凉，以一己之力试图修 复一座因自然灾害塌陷的山体。从2016年至今，他无数次回到这里，修路、挖山、植树、引水、治理山体滑坡、刻字等，甚至还为这座山取了一个极富古意的名字：“七府環屏”。也是在这个过程中，有感于个体与自然之间的力量悬殊，他开始重新审视和思考二者之间可能的共生。褚秉超的所感、所思和所行虽然没有杨福东复 杂和暧昧，但作为“愚公移山”的当代诠释，他们的作品都在诉诸某种意志的力量。\n1994年，郑国谷将鹅种到了地上；25年后，段建宇将马悬在了空中。前者来自东晋“王羲之观鹅”的典故;后者的母题是徐悲鸿的水墨写意《奔马图》。他们都试图透过动物的眼睛，找到一个新的观看世界的角度和面对人生的态度。郑国谷说:“鹅的眼睛是把所有景观都缩小，所以鹅天不怕地不怕。”段建宇说:“当你觉得自己压力巨大时，不妨想想还有人的工作是钻进大象的肛门，按摩大象前 列腺使其射精，以避免大象因发情过度造成破坏。”和“愚公移山”一样，这些 想法和举动看上去同样荒诞不羁，甚至还透着一丝狡黠的愚蠢。这对于一些人而 言，或许是缓解和释放内心焦虑、压抑和分裂的一个通道，但同时，它也是当下人类普遍的一种心理现实。 \n魔法 \n四百多年前，由于圈地运动而陷于动荡的某英格兰小镇，一位名叫埃尔斯贝丝·布 莱克（Elspeth Blake)的女性魔法师、疗愈师，因为自己的神秘主义行为而 遭到监视和迫害。艺术家瑞秋·罗斯（Rachel Rose）的影像装置《飘浮灵》（Wil-o-Wisp，2018）所讲述的正是布莱克的多舛命运。影片看似营造了一个万物有灵的魔幻森林，但它的另一面则是圈地运动所喻示的现代工业化进程。与 何子彦的《无知之云》一样，《飘浮灵》也是无边无形，但依然难掩神秘主义的 悲情和现代社会的暴力。毫无疑问，它所昭示的是一个极具分裂和冲突的世界，一个政治、经济和精神正处在剧变的时代。无论是虚构，还是非虚构，真正触动 罗斯的显然不是历史，而是同样陷入焦灼和动荡的当下。它仿佛一部寓言，预示 了一年多后的全球大变局。\n在罗斯虚构的魔法森林的“外墙”上，悬挂着一组鸟头的摄影。巧合的是，他们 所拍摄的也恰好是一些树木的局部，照片的画框就像窗户一样，与室内《飘浮 灵》的意象融为一体。在那些真真假假的树杆上，刻着“We will shoot you”或 “We will shoot”。这里的“shoot”既是拍摄，也指射击、射杀，或一种不可 见的暴力。不妨将参展的另一幅作品《拜影教》看作前者的一个注脚。顾名思义， 所谓“拜影教”一方面回应了“shoot”，反身指向摄影本身，另一方面，它也 透着一丝神秘和形而上的意味。 \n树杆上的刻痕常常是人们迷失森林时所留下的踪迹。且不论是前人所留，还是一 种神迹，它都像一个指南针一样指引着我们冲决黑暗的方向。可如今，在这个无 边无形的密林中，它却并不知道如何指引我们，或者说这里根本就没有方向。

Beyond the natural forms, the continuous changes of human life are often incorporated into the progressive logic of rationality.

This connection is often overlooked whenever we encounter a stage of social transformation or rapid development. Artists use their own descriptions to reconfirm the relationship between concept and life, which is both a mission and a destiny.","Even in the current industrial society, agricultural ethics clearly exists. This kind of coexistence is manifested at least in our yearning for an ideal life. The description of traditional aesthetics will still be maintained despite our modernity: people live in harmony in the countryside and mountains. This yearning, when externalized as a representation, is an image of pastoral life and work scenes. In recent painting creations, this type of motif is easily confined to a large number of depictions that already existed in the art history, but these depictions are often presented with simple and straightforward languages that share similarities with documentary photography. The value and poetry of the work itself are, on the contrary, difficult for the artists to obtain through depiction.","Fortunately, we can meet some specific individuals who unanimously adhere to a series of values about the human spirit, highly relevant to our life. They'll never perceive the relationship between people and nature as either backward or advanced. From the picture itself, there is no expression related to realistic language in the general sense. It neither portrays realistic scenes like photographs nor develops grand narratives with no crude cut-in and superficial mixing of traditions.

Half a century later, African-British artist John Akomfrah\n    turned his attention to this history. In the film Mnemosyne (2010), he follows the poetic paths of Dante, Beckett, Emily Dickinson, James Joyce, Milton, Nietzsche, Shakespeare, Sophocles, and Dylan Thomas to retell a history of group migration by blending the videos of immigrants into the background of snow-covered Alaska. \n    In Greek mythology, Mnemosyne, also known as Goddess of Memory, governs remembrance, language and words. In Hesiod\'s Theogony, Mnemosyne is the daughter of Uranus and Gaia, and the mother of the nine Muses by Zeus. In John Akomfrah\'s film, Dante, Beckett and others may be the epitome of the nine Muses, who together compose a sad song about migration and journeys, memories and mourning, knowledge and identity, nature and politics. If Mnemosyne is the very source of\n    the nine Muses, then in this imaginary journey through myths, legends, history and\n    all the intangibles, the shifting role of different "Muses" is constantly reminding us of individual encounters and our collective memories. \n    In 1992, Justin Tkatchenkode, a white man from Australia, migrated to Papua New Guinea (PNG). It then took only a dozen year for PNG to enter the world stage from an aboriginal society. It was also in this process that Tkatchenkode overcame multiple resistance to be elected as Minister of Land welcomed by aboriginals. In Minister, Fang Di keeps a non-fictional account of the white Minister\'s "promotion" in PNG. Minister and Mnemosyne seem to be unrelated at the first glance. But they are actually mirroring each other when put together. \n    Coincidentally, Muses is also the name for Gong Jian\'s paintings. The new series depicts the life of Anna Delvey, a German superstar who was once part of the art world and the upper class, including the scene when she was arrested for fraud. According\n    to reports, the German "super-rich beauty" who always went to high-end social\n    places and talked about billion-dollar projects turned out to be an ordinary Russian immigrant, whose real name is Anna Sorokin. In ancient Greek mythology, Muses are nine goddesses of science and the arts, who often show up in gatherings of heroes and gods, singing and dancing, bringing joy and happiness to the party. Gong Jian posits Sorokin as a contemporary Muse, surly not for any blasphemous or ironic purposes, but to convey an absurd reality, or rather the fact that absurdity is reality itself. Sorokin\'s astonishing experience is undoubtedly the most apt characterization of the current era. And it is no exaggeration to call it a myth. \n    Almost simultaneously with John Akomfrah, Singaporean artist Ho Tzu Nyen presents another gripping epic in his film The Cloud of Unknowing (2011). Inspired by A Theory of Cloud: Toward a History of Painting written by French art historian Hubert Damisch, Ho takes classic artworks of Caravaggio, Zurbarán, Correggio, Bernini, Mantegna, René Magritte and others as the blueprint, depicting protagonists in all eight sections as clouds. Similar to Homer, Dante, and Milton in Akomfrah\'s work, Caravaggio, Zurbarán, Correggio in Ho’s film also serve as symbols. Through the perspective of clouds, Damisch opened up a de-symbolic narrative syntax for the history of painting, focusing on its pragmatic implications. Ho Tzu Nyen invokes this perspective and syntax to depict the duality of colonialism in his work, which, on the one hand, gives birth to the complex identities pervading South-East Asia in the context of colonial history, and on the other hand, implies that colonization per se is an invisible violence, boundless and intangible, yet interwoven with love and hatred, good and evil, as well as other absurd, bizarre and compelling emotions and experiences. \n    Legends \n    In December 1939, Xu Beihong went to Santiniketan upon the invitation of Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore. In the following February when Gandhi visited Santiniketan, Tagore introduced Xu Beihong to Gandhi. Xu Beihong was moved by Gandhi\'s struggle for national independence and liberation when the war of resistance in China was also in full swing. They felt like old friends at the first meeting, sharing the same empathy for anti-colonial and anti-imperial movements. During the short gathering, Xu Beihong saw the spirit of Yu Gong in Gandhi. Not only did he paint a portrait for Gandhi, but he also created a special painting named Moving Mountains.\n    The legend of Yu Gong is not new to us. The painting depicts a harmonious scene on the unity of strength, where people of all nationalities, ethnics, ages and genders are marching together toward a distant goal. As symbols of two peoples and civilizations, the strong and intelligent elephant is the favorite animal of the Indians, while the ox is the most common, resilient and determined animal in China. \n    In 2016, 70 years after the victory of the war against Japanese aggression, artist Yang Fudong proceeds from Xu Beihong\'s Moving Mountains and retells this ancient story of Yu Gong. In the film, several modern intellectuals or employers in neat suits form a prominent contrast against the naked workers, presenting the encounter of two unblendable eras featuring two irreconcilable classes. Meaningfully, at the end of the film, a well-dressed modern urban youth suddenly gets up from the bathtub as if he has acquired some kind of purification, suddenly waking up from a long dream. The film focuses more on man\'s perseverance, resilience and willpower against nature rather than on the helplessness and powerlessness, presenting the spirit of "persistence" from a modern perspective. As Yang said: "When we were kids, we only learned about \'persistence\' and we didn\'t think much about it. It\'s as if we had a lot of dreams and visions when we were young, but we don\'t dare to think about them when we grow up. We don\'t know many good things, which are exactly related to dreams and visions, enabling us to live our life positively. \n    Also, in the same year, young artist Chu Bingchao went back to his hometown in Pingliang, Gansu Province, trying to restore a hill collapsing due to natural disasters with his own efforts. From 2016 on, he has returned home for countless times to build roads, dig mountains, plant trees, divert water, manage landslides and make carvings. He even gave the hill a name featuring ancient tradition: "The Hill of Qifu". It was also in this process that he began to re-examine and reflect on the possible disparity in power between the individual and nature. He started to think about the possibility for symbiosis. Chu Bingchao\'s thoughts and actions, although not as complex and ambiguous as Yang Fudong\'s, his work does serve as a contemporary interpretation of Moving Mountains. Both works are telling a story of perseverance. \n    In 1994, Zheng Guogu planted geese on the ground; 25 years later, Duan Jianyu suspended the horse in the air. The former comes from an allusion of Wang Xizhi Observing Geese in the Eastern Jin Dynasty; the latter is based on Xu Beihong\'s painting Running Horse. They both try to find a new way of looking at the world and facing life through the eyes of animals. Zheng Guogu said, "The goose is miniaturizing all the landscape in its eyes, so it is not afraid of anything." Duan Jianyu said, "When you feel stressed, think of those people whose job is to get into an elephant\'s anus and massage its prostate gland to make it ejaculate and avoid the destruction during the rut." Like Moving Mountains, these ideas and actions may seem similarly absurd, even with a hint of wry stupidity. But they may also be a way for some people to relieve and release their inner anxiety, depression and division, which is also a current universal psychological reality for human beings. \n    Magics \n    More than four hundred years ago, in an English town which was in turmoil due to the enclosure movement, Elspeth Blake, a female magician and healer, was watched and persecuted because of her mystical behaviors. Wil-o-Wisp (2018), video installation created by artist Rachel Rose, tells us the troubled fate of Blake. The film seems to create an enchanted forest where all objects, places and creatures possess a distinct spiritual essence. It also features the modern industrialisation process metaphorically represented by the enclosure movement. Just like Ho Tzu Nyen\'s The Cloud of Unknowing, Wil-o-Wisp is also boundless and intangible, revealing the sadness of mysticism and the violence of modern society. There is no doubt that it signals a highly divisive and conflicted world, a time of dramatic political, economic and spiritual change. Whether fictional or non-fictional, it\'s clearly not the history that touches Rose, but the present, which is also in a similar state of anxiety and turmoil. It is like a fable that foretells the looming global changes a year after. \n    On the "outer wall" of Rose\'s fictional enchanted forest hangs a series of photographs filmed by Birdhead. Coincidentally, these pictures feature a part of trees, and the frames are like windows, perfectly integrated in the imagery presented by Wil-o-Wisp. "We will shoot you" or "We will shoot" are carved on those trees. The word "shoot" in this context refers both to shooting a picture and shooting to kill, a form of unseen violence. We can see Phototheism, another exhibited work created by Birdhead, as a footnote to the aforementioned work. As the name implies, the so-called Phototheism, as the response to the word "shooting", points back to photography itself. On the other hand, it also contains a hint of mystery and metaphysical connotation. \n    Carvings on trees are often the tracks people leave when they get lost in the forest. And whether they are carved by our ancestors or they are simply a kind of mysterious manifestation, these carvings are supposed to serve as compasses to guide us through the darkness. But now they fail to show us the direction in such an endless andintangible dense forest. Or maybe there\'s no direction here at all.
